# pawcus

Pawcus is a unique focus application designed to help users curb the abusive use of non-productive applications. It gamifies the process of staying focused by integrating a virtual pet whose well-being is directly impacted by your application usage. Stay productive, and your pet thrives; stray into distracting apps, and your pet will show the consequences!

## core features

- **Application Monitoring**: Keeps track of applications in use.
- **Customizable Blocklist**: Users can define which applications are considered "distracting."
- **Virtual Pet Interaction**: A virtual pet's health and happiness are tied to the user's focus.
- **Progress Tracking**: Visualizations and statistics on focus streaks and application usage.
- **Notifications & Alerts**: Gentle reminders when drifting into distracting applications.

## next features

- **Strict Mode**: If the pet dies, it dies forever, and the user has to adopt a new one, losing all progress with the previous pet.
